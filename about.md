Hiiiiii! I'm currently a Computer Science and Data Science undergraduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu/)!

I am a lab assistant for [Data 8](http://data8.org/) and [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/).

I'm also a student researcher for [Goodly Labs](http://goodlylabs.org/), and I work in the Algorithm Team of the Public Editor project.
